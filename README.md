# Biased Algorithmic Decision-Making in AI-Powered Hiring

This repository explores how predictive employment models can reproduce group-patterned differences in employment outcomes. Using American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) person-level data, the project trains employment prediction models and uses group audits, SHAP, and LIME to examine how model predictions are shaped by demographic, educational, household, disability-related, and service-related variables.

The project is designed as both a technical analysis and a public-facing research artifact. It supports a conference presentation on biased algorithmic decision-making in AI-powered hiring and demonstrates how explainable AI tools can make model behavior more visible without assuming that explainability alone solves fairness concerns.

## Project Motivation

AI-powered hiring and employment screening systems are often presented as efficient and objective, but predictive models can learn from historical social and labor-market patterns. This project examines that issue using a predictive employment model as a proxy setting for understanding how algorithmic decision-making can reproduce unequal patterns.

The central question guiding this project is:

> When a model predicts employment status, what patterns does it learn, and do prediction gaps persist even when sex is removed as an input feature?

---

## Dataset

This project uses the **American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (ACS PUMS)**. ACS PUMS contains anonymized person-level survey records that allow researchers to examine employment-related outcomes alongside demographic, education, household, disability, and service-related variables.

In this project, the target variable is employment status. The analysis compares models that include and exclude sex as a feature, while retaining sex labels for post-model auditing.

The dataset is not a hiring dataset and does not represent job applicants or actual hiring decisions. Instead, it is used as a labor-market prediction setting to examine how models can encode social and structural patterns.

## Notebooks

### 1. Data Preparation

`01_data_preparation.ipynb`

Loads the ACS/PUMS data, prepares the employment target, creates readable labels, reviews missingness, and prepares the modeling dataframe.

### 2. Model Training and Group Audit

`02_model_training_and_group_audit.ipynb`

Trains two employment prediction models:

- **Model A:** includes sex as an input feature
- **Model B:** excludes sex as an input feature

Sex is retained for auditing so predicted employment rates can be compared across groups after model training.

### 3. SHAP Explainability

`03_shap_explainability.ipynb`

Uses SHAP to examine global model behavior. This notebook includes top-feature importance plots and beeswarm plots for both the model that includes sex and the model that excludes sex.

### 4. LIME Local Explanations

`04_lime_local_explanations.ipynb`

Uses LIME to explain one individual prediction. This notebook shows which features push a specific prediction toward “employed” or “not employed.”

### 5. Poster Visualizations

`05_poster_visualizations.ipynb`

Creates poster-ready versions of the final visuals using a consistent color palette, white text, dark notebook previews, and transparent image exports for PowerPoint or poster design.

## Methods

This project uses:

- Random Forest classification
- Train/test split with stratification
- Group-level prediction audits
- SHAP global explainability
- LIME local explainability
- Poster-ready data visualization with Matplotlib

The modeling workflow compares prediction patterns across two models: one trained with sex included and one trained with sex removed. This allows the project to examine whether removing a protected attribute eliminates group-patterned differences, or whether other variables may still act as proxies for social and labor-market structures.

## Intersectional Audit

Model A (includes sex) passes the four-fifths rule when audited by sex alone: the female/male predicted employment ratio is **0.948** (0.984 for Model B, which excludes sex). Auditing by sex × race tells a different story.

The table below uses the test set (n = 12,000), restricted to sex × race groups with at least 100 people. Both models use the same train/test split. Following the four-fifths rule, each group's disparate impact (DI) ratio compares its predicted employment rate with that of the highest-rate group, which is Male, Other for both models. Ratios below 0.80 are in bold.

| Sex × race group | n | Actual rate | Model A predicted | Model A DI | Model B predicted | Model B DI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Male, Other | 955 | 63.8% | 70.8% | 1.00 | 70.6% | 1.00 |
| Male, Asian | 1,022 | 65.1% | 68.4% | 0.97 | 69.7% | 0.99 |
| Female, Other | 952 | 54.6% | 67.1% | 0.95 | 70.4% | 1.00 |
| Male, Two or more races | 974 | 62.9% | 66.8% | 0.94 | 68.1% | 0.96 |
| Female, Asian | 1,230 | 56.9% | 66.3% | 0.94 | 68.0% | 0.96 |
| Female, Two or more races | 967 | 57.4% | 63.3% | 0.89 | 66.7% | 0.95 |
| Male, White | 2,563 | 59.1% | 57.7% | 0.81 | 57.9% | 0.82 |
| Male, Black | 256 | 50.0% | 53.1% | **0.75** | 52.3% | **0.74** |
| Female, Black | 258 | 46.1% | 52.7% | **0.74** | 54.3% | **0.77** |
| Female, White | 2,575 | 50.0% | 52.7% | **0.74** | 55.6% | **0.79** |

Key points:

- **A passing overall ratio hides failing subgroups.** Three sex × race groups (White women, Black women, Black men) fall below the 0.80 threshold in Model A, and White men sit just above it.
- **Removing sex does not fix it.** In Model B, the same three groups remain below 0.80. Removing sex raises predicted rates for women, but Black men fall slightly further (0.75 to 0.74). This is consistent with other variables acting as proxies for sex- and race-linked patterns.
- **The model compresses the sex gap but amplifies race gaps.** The actual sex gap is 7.9 points, while the predicted gap is 3.3 points. Among men, the gap between the Other and White groups grows from 4.6 points (actual) to 13.1 points (predicted).
- **Black women have the lowest actual employment rate** (46.1%). Compared with the highest actual-rate group (Male, Asian, 65.1%), their ratio is about 0.71 before any modeling.

Caveats: The Black subgroups are small (n ≈ 256), so their rates carry a margin of error of roughly ±6 percentage points. Results come from a single train/test split. Running `02_model_training_and_group_audit.ipynb` reproduces this table (sections 14 and 20).

## Key Takeaways

- Predictive models can learn patterns embedded in historical labor-market data.
- Removing sex from the feature set does not automatically remove group-patterned prediction differences.
- SHAP helps identify which features have the greatest influence on the model overall.
- LIME helps explain how a specific individual prediction is constructed.
- Explainability tools improve transparency, but they do not independently guarantee fairness.
- Responsible use of algorithmic systems requires auditing, governance, and human oversight.

## Poster Visual Design

The poster visuals use the following design palette:

```python
POSTER_BG = "#061529"
POSTER_BLUE = "#0393DB"
POSTER_ORANGE = "#F26B21"
POSTER_GREEN = "#2E8B45"
POSTER_RED = "#D13F35"
POSTER_WHITE = "white"
```

Most poster figures are displayed in the notebooks with a dark background for readability, but saved with transparent backgrounds for use in PowerPoint.

## Limitations

This project should be interpreted as a research and teaching demonstration rather than an operational hiring model.

Important limitations include:

- The data come from ACS labor-market survey records, not actual hiring or applicant data.
- The analysis uses binary sex categories available in the dataset, which does not fully represent gender identity.
- Prediction gaps should not be interpreted as causal evidence of discrimination.
- Explainability methods show how models use features, but they do not determine whether a system is fair.
- Removing protected attributes does not necessarily remove proxy variables or structural patterns.

---

## Ethical Framing

This project approaches algorithmic decision-making as a sociotechnical issue. Model behavior is shaped by data, feature choices, organizational context, evaluation decisions, and deployment practices. The goal is not only to improve model transparency, but also to show why technical tools must be paired with leadership, governance, and accountability.
